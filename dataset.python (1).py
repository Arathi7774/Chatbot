...     "- **Named Entities:** Identified key terms within the conversation, such as dates, locations, names, product names, or numbers.\n"
...     "- **Response Types:** Labeled responses indicating whether the reply is factual, informative, or empathetic, helping the system learn the appropriate tone and structure for replies.\n"
...     "- **Sentiment Labels:** Tags indicating whether the sentiment behind a userâ€™s utterance is positive, negative, or neutral, which helps the system adapt its response to the emotional context."

...     "Before training the NLP models, the dataset undergoes preprocessing to ensure the text data is clean and useful for model training. "
...     "This involves tokenization, cleaning the text (removing unnecessary symbols or characters), removing stop words, and applying stemming or lemmatization techniques. "
...     "Additionally, conversational history is preserved, allowing the system to generate contextually relevant replies by maintaining the flow of the conversation."

...     "depending on the diversity and complexity of conversations required. The more extensive the dataset, the better the model can generalize and handle diverse user inputs."
